\## Field Research Summary



| Participant | Role \& Background | Pain Points with Current System | View on Digital Health ID (Usefulness \& Impact) | Factors for Real Adoption | Extra Observations |

|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|

| \*\*Doctor 1 – Dr. Meenakshi Rao\*\* | MBBS, General Physician, Private Clinic (Bangalore Urban) | • 40–50% patients lack previous reports<br>• Diagnostic repetition adds ₹1,000–₹3,000/visit<br>• Hard to track chronic cases<br>• Manual data entry eats 20% of consultation time | Strongly supportive – expects 60–70% reduction in diagnostic duplication and improved accuracy | • EMR integration<br>• Fast patient lookup (<5 sec)<br>• Secure but simple access (QR/OTP) | Needs voice-to-text input and offline sync due to poor Wi-Fi |

| \*\*Doctor 2 – Dr. Anil Deshmukh\*\* | Senior Surgeon, Govt Hospital (Pune) | • 70% OPD still paper-based<br>• Lost records, repeated case sheets<br>• 5–10 mins wasted retrieving notes per patient | Supports system – could cut OPD wait by 25–30%, vital in emergencies | • Aadhaar/biometric-linked access<br>• Role-based permissions<br>• Central health cloud backup | Recommends alignment with \*\*ABDM\*\* for faster government rollout |

| \*\*Family Member 1 – Sandeep Reddy\*\* | 32, Software Engineer, Hyderabad | • Scattered reports across devices<br>• Repeatedly asked for old reports<br>• No family medical data continuity | Very positive – wants unified app for family tracking | • Auto-upload from hospitals/labs<br>• Health summary dashboard<br>• Wearables integration | Suggests WhatsApp-style sharing \& follow-up reminders |

| \*\*Family Member 2 – Radha Iyer\*\* | 58, Homemaker, Diabetic patient, Chennai | • 10+ years of paper reports<br>• Lost key data → delayed treatment<br>• Finds English apps hard | Supports if \*\*multilingual \& elderly-friendly\*\*; would reduce paper dependency | • Regional language UI<br>• Simple design, large icons<br>• Family-access with consent | Wants voice interface; prefers \*\*linked family accounts\*\* |

| \*\*Hospital Admin – Rajiv Sharma\*\* | Records Manager, District Hospital, Kerala | • 15,000+ paper files<br>• 5–15 mins retrieval time<br>• 20% lost files<br>• Manual audits impossible | Believes it can improve accuracy by 80% and cut admin workload by 50% | • Bulk data upload<br>• Real-time sync<br>• Easy staff training | Suggests daily backups, role-based dashboards, and helpline for hospitals |
